A simple maze generator and solver written in Python with Pygame where you can visualize many algorithms and see how they actually work.

Adjust the value of `Window.FPS` *(the static variable in the Window class)* to change the speed of the program.

I will add more algorithm when I have time.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7.0+

Get a copy of the Project. Assuming you have git installed, open your Terminal and enter:

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/marcpinet/epidemic-modeling.git'
```

To install all needed requirements run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running üèÉ

After that you can proceed to start the program by running `main.py`.

## TO-DO List

<ul>
    <li>Make a graphical menu instead of a console menu</li>
    <li>Make the program more modular (still encountering issues with circular imports cuz my conception sucks)</li>
    <li>Add more algorithms</li>
</ul>
